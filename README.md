# HomePredictorAI

For various occasions, I often find myself selling things door-to-door; for example, with my physics DNL class, I have to sell Gavottes, or as a scout, we regularly sell calendars at the beginning of the year. This repetitive task made me think that there must be a link between a person's home and the probability that this person will buy my products. That's why I came up with the idea of creating an AI capable of predicting whether a person will buy my products based on arbitrarily chosen criteria.

My project is divided into two "sub-projects".
Of course, there's the AI, which will be developed in Python (I haven't started yet), and the Web Application (CRUD) for collecting data. For now, I've completely finished the web application, which can be found in ./WebApp. I am currently hosting the site on 000webhost.com, and the address of my site is gavottes.000webhostapp.com. Please refrain from hacking or performing SQL injections as honestly, my site is not very secure, and I'm a beginner in web programming. My database is managed with phpMyAdmin, and my site is entirely made with Bootstrap.
