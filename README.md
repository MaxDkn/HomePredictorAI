# HomePredictorAI: Enhancing Door-to-Door Sales with AI

Do you find yourself often knocking on doors to sell products, whether it's for a school project or a community initiative? I certainly do â€“ whether it's selling Gavottes for my physics DNL class or calendars as a scout, the repetitive nature of door-to-door sales got me thinking. Is there a connection between a person's home and their likelihood to buy my products?

That's where HomePredictorAI comes in. It's my brainchild, aimed at leveraging artificial intelligence to predict whether a person is likely to purchase my products based on various arbitrarily chosen criteria.

## Project Overview:

HomePredictorAI consists of two main components:

1. **AI Development (Python):**
   The heart of the project lies in the development of an AI system using Python. While I haven't started this part yet, the plan is to train a model to predict purchase likelihood based on input parameters.

2. **Web Application (CRUD):**
   The web application, located in ./WebApp, serves as a platform for collecting data. I've already completed this aspect of the project. Currently, the site is hosted on <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/">000webhost.com</a> at <a href="https://gavottes.000webhostapp.com/">gavottes.000webhostapp.com</a>. However, I must admit, the site's security measures are not robust, and it's still a work in progress. It's built entirely with Bootstrap and managed with phpMyAdmin.
